CUSTOMIZE WITH THE CHARACTER EDITOR
To start, open the Character Editor scene located in "Assets\2D Customizable Characters\Character Editor\Scenes" and hit play.


CUSTOMIZE WITH THE INSPECTOR
Customizing through the inspector allows for fast iterations.
The characters can be found in Assets\2D Customizable Characters\Characters
Each character has a prefab folder that contains prebuilt characters ready to be customized.
It's recommended that you don't work on the included prefabs directly but instead create Prefab Variant.
On the characters, you will be mainly using three components for customization:
- Customizable Character
- Customizer
- Scale Customizer
See tooltips for detail.
